    <h3 class="tytul2">What is a self-driving car?</h3>
    <p class="tekst">A self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle, driverless car, or robo-car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. They are built using AI.</p>
    <h3 class="tytul3">How does a self-driving car work?</h3>
    <p class="tekst2">Self-driving cars have a variety of sensors that perceive the surroundings, such as:</p>
      <ul><b>
        <li>a radar</li>
        <li>a lidar</li>
        <li>a sonar</li>
        <li>a GPS</li>
        <li>odometry</li>
        <li>inertial measurement units</li>
      </b></ul>
    <p class="tekst5">In order to identify appropriate navigation paths, any obstacles or traffic signs, the car uses advanced control systems to interpret sensory information.</p>
    <h3 class="tytul4">Safety of a self-driving car</h3>
    <p class="tekst3">March 18, 2018, was the first time a self-driving car ran down a pedestrian. An Uber car with a safety driver behind the wheel hit and killed a 49-year-old woman walking her bicycle across the street in Arizona. Human driving produces one fatal accident in every 100 million miles driven. Waymo, the leader in miles driven, just reached 20 million miles driven. It hasn’t had a fatal accident yet, but given the number of miles its cars have driven, it’s simply far too soon to prove that they’re as safe as or safer than a human driver.</p>
